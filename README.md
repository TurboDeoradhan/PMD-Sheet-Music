# PMD Sheet Music
My sheet music arrangements for the PMD soundtrack. I arranged everything in the Sheet Music and Transcribed Tracks folders, but the RAW folders are direct rips from the games (For Rescue Teams and Explorers, they were extracted using PsyCommando's AudioUtil: https://github.com/PsyCommando/ppmdu_2.git).

These arrangements can also be found other sites:

Repository structure:
#Game - Each game has its own folder (Rescue Teams, Explorers, Gates, and Super).
    Sheet Music - "Finished" arrangements in MIDI, MuseScore, and PDF.
    Source Files - What I use to create arrangements.
        RAW - Ripped straight from the game, in MIDI for the DS games (Rescue Teams and Explorers) and BCSTM for the 3DS games (Gates and Super).
        Transcribed Tracks - My piano revisions of each instrument/track.
